The goal of Organice is to help student of all ages study effectively and staying on top of their tasks. It offers different variations of flashcards to study from, and to-do list, reminder and intereactive Calendar to stay on top of their tasks. 

### Why Organice?

Academic success stems from memorization. An ideal way to achieve this is with flashcards and good study habits. There are not many flashcard mediums that are easily accessible and customizable for people to use. Mainly for students who need a space to study and organize their academic study-flow. Organice solves this problem by creating a space where students can focus on school work in a single platform.
